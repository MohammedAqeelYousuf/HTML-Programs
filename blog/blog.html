    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Mohammed Aqeel Yousuf, a student of Information Technology and a tech enthusiast.
        I love learning how technology works, especially web development and cybersecurity. This is my first blog post,
        and I'm excited to share my journey as I begin learning HTML.

    <h2>Getting Started with HTML</h2>
    <p>
        Today marks the beginning of my web development journey. I started learning HTML, which stands for
        <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It's the foundation of all web pages and allows us to structure
        content on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm looking forward to learning more about how websites are built and sharing my progress here on this blog.
